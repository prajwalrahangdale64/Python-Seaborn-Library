This repository contains my personal Jupyter notebooks created during hands-on learning and practical exercises with the Python Seaborn library.

Whatâ€™s Included:

My detailed notebooks on:

    1. Distribution Plots:
                          histplot, jointplot, pairplot, rugplot, kdeplot
                          Learned to visualize univariate and bivariate distributions with histograms, kernel density estimates, and scatter/hex plots.
    2. Categorical Plots:
                         barplot, countplot, boxplot, violinplot, stripplot, swarmplot, catplot (including combined categorical plots)
                         Explored ways to visualize and compare categorical data effectively.
    3. Matrix Plots:
                    heatmap, clustermap
                    Used pivot tables and correlation matrices to visualize relationships between variables, explore data patterns, and perform clustering in tabular datasets.
    4. Grids:
             PairGrid, FacetGrid, JointGrid
             Learned to create multi-plot grids for detailed exploration of relationships across multiple variables.
    5. Regression Plots:
                        regplot, lmplot (linear model plots), working with markers, using grids with lmplot, adjusting aspect and size
                        Used Seaborn for regression analysis and fitting linear models visually.
    6. Style and Color Customization:
                                     Built-in styles, spine removal, scale and context
                                     Adjusting size and aspect for grid-based plots (FacetGrid, PairGrid, JointGrid)
                                     Adjusting figure size using matplotlib.pyplot (plt.figure(figsize=(width, height))) for standard Seaborn plots
    7. Exercises:
                 Practical, hands-on exercises
